# ðŸ¦  MSAviewer ðŸ”¬

This repository is just an implementation of https://github.com/wilzbach/msa, deployed with GitHub Pages since their official app (http://msa.biojs.net/app/) seems to be down.

This MSA (Multiple Sequence Alignment) viewer tool is meant to be used during the second lab of the Bioinformatics course.

## Usage

This application runs entirely in the browser. To use it, just access the repository page: https://santiagojn.github.io/MSAviewer/.

For more information, refer to the official webpage: http://msa.biojs.net/.

## Disclaimer

Minimal customization was made to the original project. Since it has not been updated for several years, some functionalities might not work as expected in the latest browser's versions.
